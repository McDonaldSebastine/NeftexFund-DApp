## NeftexFund DApp
NeftexFund is a decentralized funding web application built on a blockchain network that allows users to raise funds for a project or venture in a decentralized and transparent manner.

Unlike traditional fundraising methods, such as crowdfunding platforms, where intermediaries like banks or payment processors handle transactions and oversee the distribution of funds, NeftexFund uses smart contracts to execute the rules and logic of the fundraising process.

These smart contract is self-executing and self-enforcing, meaning that it automatically execute the terms of the fundraising campaign, ensuring that funds are distributed to the intended recipients and that supporters receive their rewards or tokens as agreed upon in the campaign. However, withdrawals of accrued funds are strickly automatically initiated by the application, rather than self executed by the author or owner of the campaign. This is to eliminate the tendency of owners or authors changing the initial stipulated amount of funds set to be raised and early withdrawal of funds before the campaign ends. 

NeftexFund can be used for various purposes, including crowdfunding for startups, charity fundraising, and even political campaigns. They can be accessed from anywhere in the world and offer a high degree of transparency and security, as all transactions are recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered.

## Note;
Kindly note that when testing the NeftexFund DApp using the live URL above kindly use the Polygon Mumbai Matic Testnet, and locally, you should use thesame token 
you used during the deployment stage of the smart-contract. Hence, if your primary token was matic you need to still use matic for the funding.
